                <button class="faq-question">What Are The Most Common Printer Problems?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The most common printer problem people deal with is paper jams. Degradation of printing quality due to cartridge and toner problems occurs on a regular basis. Driver problems tend to make the computers fail to recognize printers on a frequent basis. WiFi connectivity tends to frequently affect wireless printer functionality. Printers overheat when there is improper ventilation around them. The mechanical failures develop from the regular wear and tear. Our technicians handle all these common problems daily with expert solutions.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How Often Should I Perform Printer Maintenance?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Regular maintenance will make sure your printer is operating at its optimal levels. Make sure that you clean the printer externally once a year. Performing automatic cleaning cycles will result in weekly cleaning if you print regularly. Updating driver software every quarter ensures that there are compatibility updates. Change printer ink whenever it reaches the lower levels. Annual maintenance by experts ensures that unexpected situations do not lead to problems.</p>
